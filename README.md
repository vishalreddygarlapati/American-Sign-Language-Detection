# American-Sign-Language-Detection
The aim of this project is to detect ASL along with some custom gestures(space,delete) from a live video stream. I have achieved this with an accuracy of more than 90%

How to run the code:

Step1 (Run the run.bat):
1) Directly run the run.bat file and see the output.
2) Once after the code starts running we need to manually terminate the program (CTRL+C) to stop the program.

Step2 (Running the .py file):
1) For the python_code.py code to run first we need to install tensorflow.
2) We need to keep the model folder in the same folder as the python code.
3) Then we can directly run the python code and we can test the code.
4) Once after the code starts running we need to manually terminate the program (CTRL+C) to stop the program.

Note:-
- There is this zip folder called (trainingimages(A-Z)) which contains 28 sample images for all the alphabets.
